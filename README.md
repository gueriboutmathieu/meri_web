# Meri

Your loyal companion, helping you stay organized and remember what truly matters.

Meri is a little web app with only 1 button.
You can say two kinds of sentences to it:
- `statement`: Meri will remember it, example: `I need to buy some eggs at the store today.`
- `question`: Meri will search for a statement that best answers your question, example: `What do I need to buy to the store today ?`

In order to use it, you need to self-host the [server](https://github.com/gueriboutmathieu/meri_server.git).

## Setup

Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

## Run locally

You need to create a `.env` file with these values:
```
NUXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
NUXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_STT_MODEL=<openai-stt-model>
NUXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_TTS_MODEL=<openai-tts-model>
```

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:
```shell
pnpm dev
```
